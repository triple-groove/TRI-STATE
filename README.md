# TRI-STATE

TRI-STATE is an interactive art installation created in Unity for the VRChat platform. It features a mesmerizing display of triangular structures, light lines, and audio-reactive elements that respond to the beat of the music.

## Features

- Triangular structures that form a tetrahedron-like shape
- Light lines that illuminate and change colors based on audio input
- Two distinct modes of operation:
 - Mode A: Light lines illuminate one at a time, moving down the structure
 - Mode B: All light lines change color simultaneously, propagating a new color from top to bottom
- Audio-reactive elements that respond to the beat of the music as a Udon# that works with AudioLink namespace
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning

## Requirements

- Unity
- VRChat SDK
- AudioLink
