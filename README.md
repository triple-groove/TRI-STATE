TRI-STATE is an interactive art installation created in Unity for the VRChat platform. It features a mesmerizing display of triangular structures, light lines, and audio-reactive elements that respond to the beat of the music.

## Features

- Light lines that illuminate and change colors based on audio input
- Two distinct modes of operation:
 - Mode A: Light lines illuminate one at a time, moving up the structure
 - Mode B: All light lines change color simultaneously, propagating a new color from top to bottom

- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning
